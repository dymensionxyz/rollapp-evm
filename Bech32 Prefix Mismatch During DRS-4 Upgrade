I encountered an issue during the DRS-4 upgrade process on the Rollapp platform. The error message indicates a Bech32 prefix mismatch:

Expected prefix: kitty
Received prefix: KITTY
This issue appears when querying an address or restarting services after the upgrade.

Additionally, when attempting to restart services, I received the following error:

Current balance: 67 DYM (67008604481108790246adym)
Necessary balance: 6 DYM (5010000000000000000adym)
Error: failed to restart systemd services: a migration from a65646 to 7a981c is required
Steps to reproduce:

Perform the DRS-4 upgrade.
Attempt to query an address or restart services with a prefix mismatch.
Encounter the error rollapp bech32 prefix does not match.
Attempt to restart services and receive the migration error.
Expected behavior:

The Bech32 prefix should match the expected value (kitty), and the services should restart without errors.
The system should not require migration from a65646 to 7a981c for the upgrade process.
Actual behavior:

The Bech32 prefix does not match, causing errors during address queries and service restarts.
A migration from a65646 to 7a981c is required, preventing services from restarting.
This issue seems directly related to the DRS-4 upgrade process. Can you please investigate and provide a fix for this?
